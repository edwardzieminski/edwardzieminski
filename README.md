### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>I am working as Senior Business Process Analyst, however besides analysis for new app implementation, at my job I also act as developer quite often.</p>
<p>I am passionate about programming since primary school. I wrote my first program in Turbo Pascal in 2000. Since then I tried HTML, CSS, JS (jQuery), PHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, C++, QT, VBA and finally C#. It was always my hobby, but last years I decided to master my skills in C#.</p>
<p>Currently I conduct a YouTube channel for C# beginners (in Polish language). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2zTB_M-xzF8uhe2tbLahA/">LINK</a> I also conduct a blog: <a href="https://kurscsharp.pl/">LINK</a>. Those activities became my new hobby and caused that I pay even more attention to boost my C# skills.</p>
<p>Last few days I started to do Kata excercises on https://www.codewars.com/ . I publish my solutions in my GitHub organization: <a href="https://github.com/Edward-s-Codewars-Solutions">LINK</a>. And this is my current Codewars rank:</p>
