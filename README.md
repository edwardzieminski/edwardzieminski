## Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I’m a **Software Engineer** with a passion for technology and programming that started back in primary school. Here's a quick overview of my current tech stack:

### 🛠️ Technologies I work with:
- **Languages**: C#, F#, TypeScript
- **Frameworks**: ASP.NET Core, WPF, Next.js (App Router), React
- **Cloud Services (AWS)**: EC2, Lambda, Amplify, DynamoDB, RDS, Cognito
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform

### 👨‍💻 A bit about my journey:
I wrote my first program in **Turbo Pascal** in the year 2000, and since then, I've explored a variety of languages and technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery), PHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, C++, Qt, and VBA, before settling into **C#** as my primary language.

### 🎥 Projects & Community Engagement:
In the past, I ran a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2zTB_M-xzF8uhe2tbLahA/) (in Polish) focused on helping **C# beginners**. Although it’s on pause for now, I may revive it in the future!  
I also wrote articles on my blog: [Kurs C#](https://kurscsharp.pl/).

### 🧠 Problem Solving:
I enjoy sharpening my skills by solving Katas on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com), where you can check out my current rank below:
