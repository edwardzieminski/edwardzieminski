### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work as **Senior Business Process Analyst**, however besides analysis for new app implementation, at my job I also act as developer quite often.

I am passionate about programming since primary school. I wrote my first program in **Turbo Pascal** in 2000. Since then I tried HTML, CSS, JS (jQuery), PHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, C++, QT, VBA and finally C#. It was always my hobby, but last years I decided to master my skills in C#.

Currently I conduct a [YouTube channel for C# beginners](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2zTB_M-xzF8uhe2tbLahA/) (in Polish language). I also conduct [a blog](https://kurscsharp.pl/). Those activities became my new hobby and caused that I pay even more attention to boost my C# skills.

Last few days I started to do Kata excercises on https://www.codewars.com/ . I publish my solutions in my [GitHub organization](https://github.com/Edward-s-Codewars-Solutions). And this is my current Codewars rank:
